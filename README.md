# barrieros-code
A barrier is a tool for synchronizing the activity of a number of threads. When a thread reaches a barrier point, it cannot proceed until all other threads have reached this point as well. When the last thread reaches the barrier point, all threads are released and can resume concurrent execution. Assume that the barrier is initialized to N —the number of threads that must wait at the barrier point: init(N);
 Each thread then performs some work until it reaches the barrier point: 
/* do some work for a while */ barrier point ();
 /* do some work for a while */ 
Using synchronization tools described in this chapter, construct a barrier that implements the following API:
 • intinit(int n) —Initializes the barrier to the specified size. 
• int barrier point(void) —Identifies the barrier point.
  All threads are released from the barrier when the last thread reaches this point
